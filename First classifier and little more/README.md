# DO NOT TAKE IT SERIOUS

This classifier is aimed to predict next price movement: rising of falling

I used 'Volatility Index 100' candle prices (open, high, low, close prices for each 1 Hour candlestick).
This asset is proposed by Binary.com platform.
I used 8019 candles from 1st of January 2018 to 1st of December 2018 for training.

Classifier was tested on history data from 2nd December 2018 to 22 January 2019, where were 1227 candles.
54.9% of trades were successfull

You can find some indicators which were used as features.

There is 'trade' module, which was added just to discover something new. 
If you are going play with it I strongly ask you to use JUST DEMO ACCOUNT!!!
There might be problems using PyCharm. If there is, use threading or launch it another way.
